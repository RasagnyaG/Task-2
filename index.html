                <p>I was digging in our garden when I found a chest full of gold coins. I was about to run straight home to tell my wife about it, but ...</p>

                <p>Today I decided to go visit my childhood home. I asked the residents if I could come inside because I was feeling nostalgic, but they refused and slammed the door on my face. </p>
